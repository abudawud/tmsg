##Terminal Messege(tmsg) and Messege Padding (mpad)

tmsg is a programe to show messege when a user open new terminal in GNU/Linux
Operating System. When a user open new terminal tmsg will open messege data-
base which have been writen before by the user and pick one messege according
to the current index and print it to the standrd output (stdout).

tmsg must be added to the .bashrc file to make this programe run every terminal
opened. tmsg must be added on first line in .bashrc file to make sure there is 
no text has been printed by terminal (eg. hostname/user).

mpad will help you to make a messege, so text that have been you type in stdin
will reformating again to make the text not to long and add a border arroud the
messege. mpad need a 'Header' where this header will used as a title of your
messege and the messege.

Both mpad and tmsg will read and write conf file where the information about
messege is stored. So never chage the configuration file except you know what
you do
