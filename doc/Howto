for the first time you didn't have any of messege. So you need

1. run mpad program
   - there is iformation about Master and Index. this is define where your messege will be stored
     Master = 0   Index = #0  mean your messege will stored in file named msg0 with index #0
   - type your messege title/header then press enter
   - type your messege. JUST TYPE YOUR MESSEGE AND NEVER CARE ABOUT LAYOUT OF WHAT YOU TYPE!
   - after you done, pres enter and press Ctrl + D  (EOF instruction)
   - verify your messege, and press 'Y' if you sure with your messege
   - messege database(msg0) has been updated and now you have one messege.
